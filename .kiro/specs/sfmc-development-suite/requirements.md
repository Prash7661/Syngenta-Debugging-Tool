# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Syngenta SFMC (Salesforce Marketing Cloud) Development Suite is a comprehensive debugging and development tool with AI-powered capabilities designed to enhance developer productivity when working with SFMC environments. The suite provides intelligent code generation, advanced debugging capabilities, and automated cloud page generation to streamline SFMC development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a SFMC developer, I want an AI-powered code generator that supports multiple languages (SQL, AMPScript, SSJS, CSS, HTML), so that I can quickly generate accurate code snippets and complete solutions for my SFMC projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a programming language (SQL, AMPScript, SSJS, CSS, HTML) THEN the system SHALL provide language-specific code generation capabilities
2. WHEN a user provides a code generation prompt THEN the system SHALL generate syntactically correct code within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a user requests code templates THEN the system SHALL provide pre-built templates for common SFMC use cases
4. WHEN generated code is displayed THEN the system SHALL include syntax highlighting and formatting
5. WHEN a user generates code THEN the system SHALL provide explanatory comments and documentation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a SFMC developer, I want an advanced debugging tool with multi-language support, so that I can identify and resolve issues in my SQL, AMPScript, SSJS, CSS, and HTML code efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs SQL code THEN the system SHALL perform query optimization analysis and detect syntax errors
2. WHEN a user inputs AMPScript code THEN the system SHALL validate syntax and provide performance analysis recommendations
3. WHEN a user inputs SSJS code THEN the system SHALL perform debugging analysis and enforce best practices
4. WHEN a user inputs CSS/HTML code THEN the system SHALL validate markup and check responsive design compliance
5. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide real-time error highlighting with specific line numbers
6. WHEN code analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display performance metrics and optimization suggestions
7. WHEN debugging is performed THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 3 seconds for files up to 10KB

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a SFMC developer, I want a cloud pages generator that uses configuration-based generation, so that I can quickly create responsive SFMC cloud pages without manual coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides JSON/YAML configuration THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding cloud page structure
2. WHEN generating cloud pages THEN the system SHALL use pre-built responsive templates
3. WHEN creating pages THEN the system SHALL include reusable UI components optimized for SFMC
4. WHEN pages are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure mobile-responsive design
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation error messages
6. WHEN pages are created THEN the system SHALL generate clean, maintainable HTML/CSS/JavaScript code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a SFMC developer, I want seamless SFMC environment integration, so that I can authenticate and interact with my SFMC instance directly from the development suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates SFMC connection THEN the system SHALL support OAuth 2.0 authentication
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL securely store and manage JWT tokens
3. WHEN interacting with SFMC THEN the system SHALL support both REST API and SOAP API calls
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting and error responses gracefully
5. WHEN connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the development suite to support multiple concurrent users with high performance, so that my development team can work efficiently without system bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL support at least 100 concurrent users
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling capabilities
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL implement automatic load balancing
5. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN performance metrics SHALL be tracked and logged

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and user guides, so that I can quickly learn and effectively use all features of the development suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide installation and setup guides
2. WHEN learning features THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step user manuals with examples
3. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guides
4. WHEN integrating THEN the system SHALL include complete API documentation
5. WHEN contributing THEN the system SHALL provide developer guidelines and architecture documentation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can ensure code quality and system reliability across all supported languages and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL provide unit test generation capabilities
2. WHEN debugging is performed THEN the system SHALL include integration test recommendations
3. WHEN performance is analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide performance test metrics
4. WHEN security is evaluated THEN the system SHALL include security validation checks
5. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive test reports

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment and monitoring capabilities, so that I can maintain system reliability and manage releases efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support Docker containerization
2. WHEN releasing THEN the system SHALL include CI/CD pipeline integration
3. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide real-time performance and error tracking
4. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL include automated rollback procedures
5. WHEN environments are managed THEN the system SHALL support dev/staging/production configurations
